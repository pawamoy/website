# Welcome to my website :smile:

Hey, I'm Timoth√©e Mazzucotelli, **@pawamoy** on GitHub and other platforms.
I develop open-source software, primarily Python tools and libraries.
I do this full time: I earn my keep through sponsorship from individual users and companies,
which is what makes these projects sustainable and gives you a chance to use them.
Check out my [Insiders program](insiders.md) to learn more.

Below is the list of all my blog posts.
