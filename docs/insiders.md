# Insiders

Some of my projects follow the **sponsorware** release strategy, which means
that new features are first exclusively released to sponsors as part of
[Insiders][insiders]. Read on to learn [what sponsorships achieve][sponsorship],
[how to become a sponsor][sponsors] to get access to Insiders,
and [what's in it for you][features]!

```python exec="1" session="insiders"
data_source = [
    ("griffe2md", "https://mkdocstrings.github.io/griffe2md/", "insiders/goals.yml"),
    ("griffe-pydantic", "https://mkdocstrings.github.io/griffe-pydantic/", "insiders/goals.yml"),
    ("markdown-exec", "https://pawamoy.github.io/markdown-exec/", "insiders/goals.yml"),
    ("mkdocs-manpage", "https://pawamoy.github.io/mkdocs-manpage/", "insiders/goals.yml"),
    ("mkdocstrings-python", "https://mkdocstrings.github.io/python/", "insiders/goals.yml"),
    ("pypi-insiders", "https://pawamoy.github.io/pypi-insiders/", "insiders/goals.yml"),
]
```

Current projects offering an Insiders version:

```python exec="1" session="insiders"
for project_name, project_url, _ in data_source:
    print(f"- [{project_name}]({project_url})")
```

## What is Insiders?

Insiders are private forks of my projects, hosted as
private GitHub repositories. Almost[^1] [all new features][features]
are developed as part of these forks, which means that they are immediately
available to all eligible sponsors, as they are made collaborators of this
repository.

  [^1]:
    In general, every new feature is first exclusively released to sponsors, but
    sometimes upstream dependencies enhance existing features that must be supported.

Every feature is tied to a [funding goal][funding] in monthly subscriptions. When a
funding goal is hit, the features that are tied to it are merged back into
the public projects and released for general availability, making them available
to all users. Bugfixes are always released in tandem.

Sponsorships start as low as [**$10 a month**][sponsors].[^2]

  [^2]:
    Note that $10 a month is the minimum amount to become eligible for
    Insiders. While GitHub Sponsors also allows to sponsor lower amounts or
    one-time amounts, those can't be granted access to Insiders due to
    technical reasons. Such contributions are still very much welcome as
    they help ensuring the project's sustainability.


## What sponsorships achieve

Sponsorships make this project sustainable, as they buy the maintainers of this
project time – a very scarce resource – which is spent on the development of new
features, bug fixing, stability improvement, issue triage and general support.
The biggest bottleneck in Open Source is time.[^3]

  [^3]:
    Making an Open Source project sustainable is exceptionally hard: maintainers
    burn out, projects are abandoned. That's not great and very unpredictable.
    The sponsorware model ensures that if you decide to use my Insiders projects,
    you can be sure that bugs are fixed quickly and new features are added
    regularly.

If you're unsure if you should sponsor my projects, check out the list of
[completed funding goals][goals completed] to learn whether you're already using features that
were developed with the help of sponsorships. You're most likely using at least
a handful of them, [thanks to our awesome sponsors][sponsors]!

## What's in it for me?

```python exec="1" session="insiders"
--8<-- "scripts/insiders.py"

print(f"""The moment you <a href="#how-to-become-a-sponsor">become a sponsor</a>, you'll get **immediate
access to {len(unreleased_features)} additional features** that you can start using right away, and
which are currently exclusively available to sponsors:\n""")

for feature in unreleased_features:
    feature.render(badge=True)
```

## How to become a sponsor

Thanks for your interest in sponsoring! In order to become an eligible sponsor
with your GitHub account, visit [pawamoy's sponsor profile][github sponsor profile],
and complete a sponsorship of **$10 a month or more**.
You can use your individual or organization GitHub account for sponsoring.

**Important**: If you're sponsoring **[@pawamoy][github sponsor profile]**
through a GitHub organization, please send a short email
to pawamoy@pm.me with the name of your
organization and the GitHub account of the individual
that should be added as a collaborator.[^4]

You can cancel your sponsorship anytime.[^5]

  [^4]:
    It's currently not possible to grant access to each member of an
    organization, as GitHub only allows for adding users. Thus, after
    sponsoring, please send an email to pawamoy@pm.me, stating which
    account should become a collaborator of the Insiders repository. We're
    working on a solution which will make access to organizations much simpler.
    To ensure that access is not tied to a particular individual GitHub account,
    create a bot account (i.e. a GitHub account that is not tied to a specific
    individual), and use this account for the sponsoring. After being added to
    the list of collaborators, the bot account can create a private fork of the
    private Insiders GitHub repository, and grant access to all members of the
    organizations.

  [^5]:
    If you cancel your sponsorship, GitHub schedules a cancellation request
    which will become effective at the end of the billing cycle. This means
    that even though you cancel your sponsorship, you will keep your access to
    Insiders as long as your cancellation isn't effective. All charges are
    processed by GitHub through Stripe. As we don't receive any information
    regarding your payment, and GitHub doesn't offer refunds, sponsorships are
    non-refundable.

  If you sponsor publicly, you're automatically added here with a link to
  your profile and avatar to show your support for my projects.
  Alternatively, if you wish to keep your sponsorship private, you'll be a
  silent +1. You can select visibility during checkout and change it
  afterwards.

## Funding <span class="sponsors-total"></span>

### Goals

The following section lists all funding goals. Each goal contains a list of
features prefixed with a checkmark symbol, denoting whether a feature is
:octicons-check-circle-fill-24:{ style="color: #00e676" } already available or 
:octicons-check-circle-fill-24:{ style="color: var(--md-default-fg-color--lightest)" } planned,
but not yet implemented. When the funding goal is hit,
the features are released for general availability.

```python exec="1" session="insiders" idprefix=""
for goal in goals.values():
    if not goal.complete:
        goal.render()
```

### Goals completed

This section lists all funding goals that were previously completed, which means
that those features were part of Insiders, but are now generally available and
can be used by all users.

```python exec="1" session="insiders"
for goal in goals.values():
    if goal.complete:
        goal.render()
```

## Frequently asked questions

### Payment

> We don't want to pay for sponsorship every month. Are there any other options?

Yes. You can sponsor on a yearly basis by [switching your GitHub account to a
yearly billing cycle][billing cycle]. If for some reason you cannot do that, you
could also create a dedicated GitHub account with a yearly billing cycle, which
you only use for sponsoring (some sponsors already do that).

If you have any problems or further questions, please reach out to pawamoy@pm.me.

### Terms

> Are we allowed to use Insiders under the same terms and conditions as
the public project?

Yes. Whether you're an individual or a company, you may use the Insiders versions
precisely under the same terms as the public versions, which are generally given
by the [ISC License][license]. However, we kindly ask you to respect our
**fair use policy**:

- Please **don't distribute the source code** of Insiders. You may freely use
  it for public, private or commercial projects, privately fork or mirror it,
  but please don't make the source code public, as it would counteract the 
  sponsorware strategy.

- If you cancel your subscription, you're automatically removed as a
  collaborator and will miss out on all future updates of Insiders. However, you
  may **use the latest version** that's available to you **as long as you like**.
  Just remember that [GitHub deletes private forks][private forks].
