This post shows a few things that I consider best-practices,
and a few other things that you should avoid when writing
a Python command-line tool and/or library.

<!--more-->

## Motivation

Stems from duty, task runner that can run Python callables.
Toot on Mastodon, quote from docs "call to developers".

- people *will* want to use your tool programatically,
    whether you provide a public interface or not
- it is just easier to write, maintain and test

## Kindness disclaimer

- it's fine not to care about programatic use (though it makes things easier)
- no judgments on the projects I mention as examples of what to do or not:
    written by people when they didn't have experience,
    or didn't think/care about programatic use

## Do's and don'ts

- don't tie logic to your CLI (BE: black, coverage)
- think "library first" (BE: pydeps)
- decide what you expose in the CLI, write a function for each
- accept only built-in types in these functions
- the CLI just translates CLI arguments to Python arguments
- capture stdout/stderr of subprocess and re-print it
- don't exit the process in functions
- avoid fancy IO management
- avoid fancy decorators
- use `main.py` and `cli.py`
- @ionelmc's wisdom `__main__.py`
- accepts args in your CLI entrypoints
- (unsure) if you operate on files, accepts directories and implement discovery/recursion
- (tyro) https://brentyi.github.io/tyro/examples/01_basics/01_functions/ not good,
  hides actual CLI args

## Benefits

- providing a callable means it will work for every version of your project
    (impossible otherwise)



## Bad examples

- Twine adds logic to its `__main__.main` function which does not accept arguments.
- pyproject-build defines its main method in `__main__`.
